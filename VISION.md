### Why Bother?

Hosted Danger comes with a few interesting ramifications. 

* Installation can literally be a single click on the website.
* Because she's not running on CI, Danger can run on any webhook.

I've wanted to do this for a [long, long time](https://github.com/danger/danger/issues/42) and the re-write aspect of Danger JS means that I could apply the constraints necessary for running hosted from day-1.
